<p>Think about that glorious day of the birth of Jesus Christ. The day when Simeon looked at God, humbled in the form of a baby, and declared that he had seen (In past tense) The Consolation of Israel. And now, imagine that it never happened.</p><p>No men came from the East bearing gifts of worship because there was no Son to bring them to. Mary lived a normal teenaged life because there was no Messiah growing in her womb. Jesus did not live in blameless innocence and die as a sacrifice for the sins of man. He never drank that cup his Father had given him in the garden. So the wine of the fury of the wrath of God has not been satisfied. Consider how meaningless a cross is without a Christ.</p><p>For Christians, it takes a fantastic imagination to dream up a world without a Savior. But for the majority of the population of Earth, this miserable nightmare is their reality. While American Christians wake up on December 25th to open gifts under the tree, a Muslim boy in Iraq wakes up to nothing. Nothing is different that day for a Buddhist girl in Nepal. None of them know there is a Christ to rescue them from the corrupted nature they have inherited and contribute to every day with their sin. They know nothing of a God who was so powerful yet so compassionate that he humbled himself by becoming like us so he could be the sacrifice for us. Sure, the world’s children have their hope in religious structures and morality, but we all know better. We know that when they stand before God to be judged, they will not have Jesus as their Advocate and Defender. These kids have the Christ-less life that we who have been saved can only strain our minds to imagine.</p><p>“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” - John 3:36</p><p>Let John 3:36 ring out this Christmas. Let that be our verse for the holiday. Perhaps it will realign our focus on the reason Christ came. Maybe this will emphasize again the inescapable role of every Christian. It ought to be inconceivable for us to think about a person going to Hell without ever hearing the only name under Heaven by which a man may be saved (Acts 4:12).</p><p>Now think again about that glorious day of his birth. Knowing that what Simeon declared indeed is true. Mary truly carried the body of our Lord in her womb. Jesus bore God’s wrath, he swallowed the cup. There is no punishment due to you because Jesus took it on your behalf. Remember the selflessness of God to not withhold his own Son as a gift to those who will worship him. God did not spare his Son. Jesus did not spare his life. And the disciples did not spare theirs, but loved not their lives even unto death (Revelation 12:11). So we, as beneficiaries of this covenant that God cut with the blood of his Son, should not withhold this marvelous good news from those who have no access to it. The gift you can give to missionaries is not really for them. And it’s not really even to the people they are going to. The gift you give is actually a gift to Jesus. What every missionary wants for Christmas is help shouldering the weight of advancing the gospel. By this, you are giving Jesus what he truly wants for Christmas… to save human souls.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">What Every Gospel Worker Wants for Christmas</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
